# Cow-Teats-Stall-Number-Analysis-Using-Object-Detection

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description
This project implements **deep learning-based object detection** to accurately recognize **cow stall numbers** from images. By leveraging a **fine-tuned ResNet-50 model**, this study automates the stall identification process, optimizing **efficiency and accuracy** in dairy farm management.

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement
Traditional **manual stall number identification** is **time-consuming and error-prone**, affecting **dairy farm management and animal tracking**. This project aims to automate stall number recognition using **computer vision** and **deep learning techniques**.

##  Methodology
- **Dataset:** Cow stall number dataset with **1042 training images** and **261 test images**.
- **Preprocessing:** Image resizing, normalization, and **augmentation techniques (random crop, center crop, and rotation)**.
- **Model:** **Fine-tuned ResNet-50** trained using **transfer learning**.
- **Evaluation Metrics:**  
  - **Classification Accuracy:** 71%  
  - **Localization Precision (IoU Score):** 57.85%  
- **Loss Functions:**  
  - **Cross-Entropy Loss** for classification.  
  - **Smooth L1 & IoU Loss** for bounding box predictions.  

## ðŸ”¬ Key Insights
- The **deep learning-based approach significantly improves stall number identification accuracy**.
- **Challenges remain in localization precision**, requiring further **model tuning and data augmentation**.
- **Future Scope:** Explore **YOLO-based models** for improved **real-time detection**.
